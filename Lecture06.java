        // SELF-CHECK PROBLEMS:
        // Note: you may need to put some of your answers inside comments

        // Put your answer for #1 here: the choice between using recursion and iteration depends on the nature of the problem and the programming language you are using. Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving certain types of problems, but it should be used judiciously to avoid excessive memory consumption and stack overflow errors.

        // Put your answer for #2 here: recursive function, base cases and recursive cases work in harmony to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and gradually solving them. 

        // Put your answer for #3 here:
        // Part A:1

        // Part B:1,2

        // Part C:1,3

        // Part D:1,2,4

        // Part E: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

        // Part F: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30

        // Part G: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100

        // Put your answer for #5 here:
        // Part A:*

        // Part B:[*]

        // Part C:([])

        // Part D: ([])

        // Put your answer for #6 here:
        // Part A:4

        // Part B: 8,4,8
,
        // Part C:16,8,16

        // Part D: 12, 8, 4, 8, 12

        //Part E: 12, 9, 3, 9, 12
